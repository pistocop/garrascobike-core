    - Manage both parsing and entities extraction in one script could be a risk
- [ ] How manage the connection between models and requirements.txt?
- [ ] Support multiple languages
    - [ ] We need to manage multiple installation for multiple models
- [ x ] Log if GPU is attached
- [ ] Log running stats
