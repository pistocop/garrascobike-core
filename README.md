## Entities extraction

- Store the entities in `parquet` for better compatibility with future

# ðŸ’¤ TODO

- [ ] [!] Store dataset info, both _subreddit-dl_ and _entities_extraction.py_
- [ ] Can we speed up entities extractions with batch approach?
- [ ] Reorder /core/ scripts under different folders
- [ ] Info logging system: print the main 3 phases [init / processing / storing]
    - [ ] Log running stats
    - Not required: preprocessing is already really fast
- [ ] We should improve the text parsing?
    - [ ] Refactory: manage both parsing and entities extraction in one file script could be a risk
- [ ] How manage the connection between models and requirements.txt?
    - [ ] Support multiple languages
    - [ ] We need to manage multiple installation for multiple models
- [  ] Create Elasticsearch indexes creation
    - [  ] Use ES templates
- [  ] "03_matrix_builder.py" Fetch and store only entities required from elasticsearch
- [ x ] Use library for pandas CPU parallelism
- [ x ] Log if GPU is attached
